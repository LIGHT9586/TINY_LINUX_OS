  The Core Project, as suggested by our name, is not a turnkey desktop distribution. Instead we deliver just the core Linux from which it is quite easy to add what you want. We offer 3 different x86 "cores" to get you started: Core, TinyCore, and our installation image, CorePlus.

---> Core(17 MB)	
          Core is the base system which provides only a command line interface and is therefore recommended for experienced users only. Command line tools are provided so that extensions can be added to create a system with a graphical desktop environment. Ideal for servers, appliances, and custom desktops.
        
---> TinyCore(23 MB)
          TinyCore is the recommended option for new users who have a wired network connection. It includes the base Core system plus X/GUI extensions for a dynamic FLTK/FLWM graphical desktop environment.
          
---> CorePlus(248 MB)
          CorePlus is an installation image and not the distribution. It is recommended for new users who only have access to a wireless network or who use a non-US keyboard layout. It includes the base Core System and installation tools to provide for the setup with the following options: Choice of 7 Window Managers, Wireless support via many firmware files and ndiswrapper, non-US keyboard support, and a remastering tool.
